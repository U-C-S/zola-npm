## What is Zola ?

Zola is a static site generator (SSG), similar to Hugo, Pelican, and Jekyll. It is written in Rust and uses the [Tera](https://tera.netlify.com/) template engine, which is similar to Jinja2, Django templates, Liquid, and Twig. Content is written in [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/), a strongly defined, highly compatible specification of Markdown.
